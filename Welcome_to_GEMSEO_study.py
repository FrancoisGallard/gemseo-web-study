The GEMSEO Study helps to define the right MDO problem to be
solved before writing any code.

The user only has to define the disciplines by their names,
as well as the input and output names.

Then, the scenario is defined by the names of the objectives, constraints,
design variables, and the selection of the MDO formulation.

The result of the analysis are a N2 and XDSM diagrams.

The N2 (pronounce "N square") diagram represents the coupling between the disciplines, see: [link]({}).

The XDSM (eXtended Design Structure Matrix) diagram represents MDO process.
In particular, it is a standard to represent the MDO formulations, see: [link]({}).
